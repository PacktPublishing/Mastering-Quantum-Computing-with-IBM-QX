This is the code repository for [Mastering Quantum Computing with IBM QX](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/mastering-quantum-computing-ibm-qx?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789136432), published by Packt.

**Learn quantum computing by implementing quantum programs on IBM QX and be at the forefront of the next revolution in computation**

## What is this book about?
Quantum computing is set to disrupt the industry. IBM Research has made quantum computing available to the public for the first time, providing cloud access to IBM QX from any desktop or mobile device. Complete with cutting-edge practical examples, this book will help you understand the power of quantum computing in the real world.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Study the core concepts and principles of quantum computing 
* Uncover the areas in which quantum principles can be applied 
* Design programs with quantum logic 
* Understand how a quantum computer performs computations 
* Work with key quantum computational algorithms including Shor's algorithm and Grover's algorithm 
Develop the ability to analyze the potential of quantum computing in your industry

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter01.

The code will look like the following:
```
from qiskit.tools.visualization import plot_histogram
plot_histogram(job_exp.result().get_counts(qc))
```
### To setup book code and Python virtual environment
Run the following commands step wise to set up Python virtual environment:
* ```git clone https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-Quantum-Computingwith-IBM-QX.git```
* ```cd Mastering-Quantum-Computing-with-IBM-QX```
* ```python3 -m venv book```
* ```source book/bin/activate```
* ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
* ```pip install ipykernel```
* ```ipython kernel install --user --name=bookkernel```

Note: if Python is a version of Python 3 on your system, you may need to/want to type Python instead of Python3 above

### To run a jupyter notebook from commandline, exporting results to Markdown
Use the following command to run Jupyter Notebook:
```
jupyter notebook
```

Navigate to your notebook in the browser. Then go to Kernel | bookkernel in the
notebook's UI.
